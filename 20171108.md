### How to play

- Run all tasks:

```shell
ansible-playbook sample_playbook.yml
```

- Ask for the remote host sudo password and run all tasks:

```shell
ansible-playbook sample_playbook.yml -K
```

- Run only the tasks with a given tag:

```shell
ansible-playbook sample_playbook.yml --tags test
ansible-playbook sample_playbook.yml --tags test,stop
```

- List all modules in the system:

```shell
ansible-doc -l

```

**IMPORTANT:**
- You should authorize your local ssh key in all your nodes to avoid complex
  settings:

```shell
// copy your ssh key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

// access your node
ssh user@192.168.1.122

// authorize your key to access the node
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys // paste
```
